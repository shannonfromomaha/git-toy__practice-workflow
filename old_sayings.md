Old Sayings That Deserve To Be Used:
Bee's Knees, Cat's Pajamas, or any other animal-and-their-thing combo that means "great"
Any and all sayings that older women use in Kentucky (non-racially-charged)
Roger (Sumeet uses this all the time and I think it's great)
Rad, Boss, Tight (I still use all these)
